For a while I've been very much interested in Tech, and all the emerging technologies that I've been thinking of how much I desperately wanted to have a career path in Tech. I knew that whatever I decided to do would also be in sync with what I've always done- WRITING! And I’ve been reading about IoT’s, AI, Cloud computing, Robotics, Block Chain, and Cybersecurity seemed to be one of those underemphasized aspects of technology especially since we’re evolving every ticking second of every ticking day. Maybe we will never understand the reasons why Cybersecurity, however important, seems to be on the sidelines considering how everything in the world of technology hinges on it, but I’m happy to talk about a few things you may have ignored moments up until now.

In recent years, Cybersecurity has become increasingly common and thanks to the rising number of digital theft and security breaches both small and big businesses are struggling with. Unsuspecting internet users get their passwords and personal information stolen from social media and websites by unscrupulous hackers who also pluck company secrets from the cloud. Information safety is a growing concern for everyone.

### **What is Cybersecurity?**

Cybersecurity encompasses a broad range of technologies, practices, and processes aimed at safeguarding computers, networks, data, and other digital assets from various threats, including unauthorized access, data breaches, cyber attacks, and more.

The definition provided by the [Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/news/what-cybersecurity#:~:text=Cybersecurity%20is%20the%20art%20of,integrity%2C%20and%20availability%20of%20information.) succinctly captures the essence of cybersecurity. Let's break it down:

* Protecting networks, devices, and data: This involves implementing measures and protocols to prevent unauthorized access to networks, devices (such as computers, smartphones, IoT devices), and sensitive data. This can include using firewalls, encryption, access controls, and other security technologies.
    
* Ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability: These are the three pillars of information security. Confidentiality ensures that only authorized individuals or systems can access certain information. Integrity ensures that data remains accurate, trustworthy, and unaltered. Availability ensures that information and resources are accessible to authorized users when needed, without interruption.
    

### How is this different from Information Security?

Information security is a vital component of cybersecurity, and while the terms are often used interchangeably, they do have distinct focuses. Information security specifically targets the protection of confidential business data from a range of potential threats.

Information security pertains to the strategies and technologies deployed to safeguard sensitive business data. This includes measures to prevent unauthorized access, alteration, destruction, or examination of data. Information security encompasses various practices such as encryption, access controls, authentication mechanisms, and data loss prevention (DLP) solutions. Its primary aim is to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data. While information security is focused on protecting data, cybersecurity has a broader scope. Cybersecurity encompasses the protection of not only data but also computer systems, networks, devices, and other digital assets from a wide range of cyber threats. These threats may include malware, phishing attacks, denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, insider threats, and more. Cybersecurity strategies and technologies encompass a holistic approach to safeguarding the entirety of the digital ecosystem, including people, processes, and technology.

### What are Some of the ways Cyber Attacks and Threats happen?

Cyber Attacks are all similar in damages but technically, they come in different forms. The most recognized attacks are:

1. **Malware**: Malware, short for malicious software, encompasses a variety of intrusive software designed by cybercriminals to compromise computers and systems. As mentioned, malware can be used for various malicious purposes, including data exfiltration, system damage, and unauthorized access. Examples of malware include viruses, worms, trojans, spyware, adware, and ransomware.
    
2. **Phishing**: Phishing attacks involve the use of fraudulent communications, such as emails or phone calls, to deceive recipients into divulging sensitive information or installing malware. Attackers often masquerade as legitimate entities to trick individuals into providing personal or financial information. Phishing attacks can also serve as a means to deliver malware onto a victim's device.
    
3. **Ransomware**: Ransomware is a specific type of malware that encrypts files on a victim's device, rendering them inaccessible. The attackers then demand a ransom payment from the victim in exchange for providing the decryption key to unlock the files. Ransomware attacks can have severe consequences, disrupting business operations and causing financial losses.
    
4. **Viruses**: Viruses are a type of malware designed to spread from one computer to another, often via infected files or documents. Once a virus infects a system, it can execute malicious actions, such as damaging files, stealing data, or disrupting system functions. Viruses may disguise themselves as legitimate programs to trick users into executing them, thereby facilitating their spread.

### So Why is Cybersecurity Increasingly Important?

Today, more than ever, the threat of cybercrime looms larger than ever. It's not just about safeguarding confidential data; it's about protecting relationships with customers and avoiding legal entanglements. With technological advancements like self-driving cars and internet-enabled home security systems, the stakes have never been higher.

[According to Gartner](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2023-09-28-gartner-forecasts-global-security-and-risk-management-spending-to-grow-14-percent-in-2024), a leading research and advisory firm, global spending on cybersecurity was projected to skyrocket, reaching $188.1 billion in 2023 and an estimated $214.9 billion by 2024. The demand for cybersecurity practitioners is at an all-time high.

In the interconnected world we live in, everything from state secrets to personal information is at risk. A single breach, as demonstrated by the Equifax incident in 2017, can compromise the data of millions, as hackers are nonstop trying to invade secure information [every 39 seconds](https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna17034719) according to research. This underscores the critical importance of cybersecurity in safeguarding sensitive information.

Here are the top reasons why cybersecurity is more vital than ever, and necessary measures to have one in place is quite urgent:

1\. Cyber attacks do not discriminate: No longer limited to mega-corporations, cybercrime affects individuals and businesses alike. Automated scripts scour the internet for vulnerabilities, posing a constant threat to anyone with online access.

2\. Sensitive data is becoming more digitized: The digitalization of various sectors means an influx of sensitive information stored in the cloud, increasing the likelihood of data breaches and leaks.

3\. A boom in e-commerce indicates a boom in cyber threats: The shift to online shopping has made businesses lucrative targets for cybercriminals, who seek to exploit vulnerabilities in supply chains and customer databases.

4\. Cyber attack remediations are financially costly: The aftermath of a cyber attack can be financially devastating, with expenses ranging from forensic investigations to legal fees and penalties.

5\. Cyber attacks harm reputations: Organizations that fall victim to cyber attacks often suffer reputational damage, leading to loss of consumer trust and decreased market value.

6\. Personal cyber-attack threats are intrusive: Individuals are vulnerable to a range of cyber threats, from identity theft to ransomware attacks, highlighting the need for personal cybersecurity measures.

7\. Litigating cybercrimes is an arduous process: The legal fallout from cybercrimes can be lengthy and costly, with breached companies facing litigation from shareholders and regulatory bodies.

8\. Cybercrime is a national security threat: With the internet connecting the world, cyber attacks pose a significant risk to national security, with potential implications for infrastructure and economic stability.

9\. Business interruption is a direct result of cybercrime: Cyber attacks can disrupt business operations, leading to lost productivity and revenue, particularly for small and emerging enterprises.

10\. Widespread availability of the dark web poses new challenges: The anonymity of the dark web enables illegal activities and underscores the importance of cyber resilience in protecting against malicious online activities.

I'd say again that, cybersecurity is not just a necessity; it's a fundamental pillar of defense against an ever-evolving threat landscape. Whether you're an individual user or a multinational corporation, understanding and implementing robust cybersecurity measures is essential in safeguarding against the pervasive threat of cybercrime.
