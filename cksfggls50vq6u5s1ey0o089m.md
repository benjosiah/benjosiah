Just started the  [HNGi8](https://internship.zuri.team)  internship, and I am so excited. I have lots of expectations from this programme and I'll love to share a few.

### My Goals and Expectations 

- Growth: I am looking forward to growing my skill during this 8 weeks programme

- Team Spirit: I Strongly want to build my team spirit and get more experience working and growing in a team

- Build Projects: I am looking forward to building projects and solving real-life problems with my skills

- Get the HNG T-shirt: I look forward to being one of the HNG finalists and get to earn a T-shirt

I believe that I have come to the right place and I am ready to put in the work that would enable me to excel in this programme
