## **Step 1: Gather the Requirements**

To build a cybersecurity home lab, you need **hardware, software, and security tools**. Here’s a list of what you’ll need:

### **1\. Hardware Requirements**

* A **computer with at least 8GB of RAM** (16GB or more is ideal for running multiple virtual machines).
    
* **Enough storage space** (at least **250GB SSD**, but more is better).
    
* A **reliable internet connection** (some labs require online access).
    
* An **external USB drive** (optional, but useful for portable tools).
    

If your main computer isn't powerful enough, you can buy a **used workstation or a mini PC** to dedicate to your lab.

### **2\. Software Requirements**

* **Virtualization Software** – This allows you to run multiple operating systems on your computer without affecting your main system. The two best options I know are;
    
    * VirtualBox (Free)
        
    * VMware Workstation Player (Free for personal use)
        
* **Operating Systems:**
    
    * **Kali Linux** (Offensive security testing)
        
    * **Windows 10/11** (To test security vulnerabilities)
        
    * **Ubuntu/Debian** (Common Linux environment for servers)
        
* **Security Tools:**
    
    * Wireshark (for Network traffic analysis)
        
    * Metasploit (for Penetration testing)
        
    * Splunk (for Log monitoring and analysis)
        
    * Burp Suite (for Web application security testing)
        
    * Nmap (for Network scanning)
        

## **Step 2: Install Virtualization Software**

Running everything inside a virtual machine (VM) is the safest way to test software, practice ethical hacking, or analyze malware without affecting your actual system.

First, download and install virtualization software. Choose between [**VirtualBox**](https://www.virtualbox.org/) (free and open-source) or [**VMware Workstation Player**](https://www.vmware.com/products/desktop-hypervisor/workstation-and-fusion) (free for personal use). After downloading, run the installer and follow the setup instructions. If using VirtualBox, also install the **VirtualBox Extension Pack** for added features. If necessary, restart your computer.

Next, create a new virtual machine in your chosen software:

* **VirtualBox:** Click **“New”**, enter a name, select the OS type and version, then click **"Next"**.
    
* **VMware Workstation Player:** Click **"Create a New Virtual Machine"**, select **"Installer Disc Image (ISO)"**, choose the OS ISO file, and specify a VM name and location.
    

After creating the VM, allocate system resources to ensure smooth performance:

* **RAM:** At least 2GB (preferably 4GB+ for heavier OS like Windows 10 or Kali Linux).
    
* **Storage:** Minimum 20GB (40GB+ recommended for extensive testing).
    
* **CPU Cores:** Allocate at least 2 cores for better performance.
    

Once the VM is configured, install an operating system inside it. Download the ISO file for your chosen OS (e.[g](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10)., [K](https://ubuntu.com/download)ali Linux, Ubuntu, or Windows 10). Attach the ISO file to the VM:

* **VirtualBox:** Go to **Settings → Storage**, select the empty disk, and choose the ISO file.
    
* **VMware:** Choose **"Installer Disc Image"** during setup.
    

Start the VM, follow the OS installation prompts, and reboot once completed.

Next, configure networking settings based on your needs:

* **NAT (Network Address Translation):** Default mode, allows internet access.
    
* **Bridged Network:** Connects the VM directly to your host network.
    
* **Host-Only:** Isolates the VM from the internet (ideal for malware testing).
    

To set this up:

* **VirtualBox:** Go to **VM** [**S**](https://ubuntu.com/download)**ettings → Network → Adapter Type**.
    
* **VMware:** Go to **VM Settings → Network Adapter → Select Mode**.
    

For better performance, install guest utilities:

* **VirtualBox:** Start VM → **Devices → Insert** **Guest Additions CD** **Image** → Follow installation steps.
    
* **VMware:** Start VM → **Player → Manage → Install** **VMware Tools**.
    

Finally, take snapshots to create restore points in case of issues:

* **VirtualBox:** Open VM → **Snapshots** **→ Take Snapshot**.
    
* **VMware:** Open VM → **Take Snapshot**.
    

**Why Virtual** **Machines?** If something goes wrong (like a system crash or malware infection), you can **reset the VM in seconds** without affecting your actual computer.

## **Step 3:** **Set Up Your First Hacking** **and Security Tools**

Now that your VMs are ready, it’s time to **install and configure** **security** **tools**.

* Download it from Kali.org.
    
* Load it into VirtualBox or VMware.
    
* Run an update:
    
    ```plaintext
    bashCopy codesudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
    ```
    
* Install additional tools like Metasploit and Nmap if needed.
    

### **2\. Install a** **Windows 10 Virtual Machine (For Testing** **Exploits)**

Since Windows is widely used in enterprise environments, understanding its vulnerabilities is essential for penetration testing. Setting up a **Windows 10 virtual machine** allows you to safely test exploits in a controlled environment.

First, download a **Windows 10 ISO** file from [**Microsoft’s official website**.](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10) You’ll need this file to [i](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10)nstall Windows inside the VM. If you don’t have a valid product key, you can use the trial version.

Next, create a **new virtual machine** in VirtualBox or VMware:

* **VirtualBox:** Click **"New"**, name the VM "Windows 10", and select **Windows** **10 (64-bit)**.
    
* **VMware Workstation Player:** Click **"Create a New Virtual Machine"**, select **"Installer Disc Image (ISO)"**, and choose the Windows 10 ISO file.
    

Then, allocate system resources for smooth operation:

* **RAM:** At least 4GB (8GB+ recommended).
    
* [**Storage:**](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10) Minimum 40GB (more for advanced testing).
    
* **CPU Cores:** At least 2 cores.
    

Once configured, start the VM and install Windows 10 by following the setup wizard. After installation, proceed with these key configurations:

* **Install and configure Windows Defender Firewall & Event Viewer** for monitoring logs.
